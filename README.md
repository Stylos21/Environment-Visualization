I'll write some more details here, but this project is a work in progress.

Disclaimer: I used the "GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv" from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) file to visualize the map. However, I had to manually modify the CSV file (ik I'm dumb for not using python to automate the modifications) to rename/remove the countries that mismatched with d3geo's country list for its projection.
